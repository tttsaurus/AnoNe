 * Marks the type (most notably {@link java.util.Collection} or {@link java.util.Map}) as having an unmodifiable view.
 * This would mean that the annotated type would error or produce no effect
 * when any mutator methods such as {@link java.util.Collection#add(Object)} is called.
 * This annotation doesn't ensure the complete immutability as the object may still be able to be mutated in a different context.
 * <p>
 * It has weaker semantics than {@link Immutable}.
