 * It specifies which methods are required to call the annotated method.
 * <p>
 * With the default parameters, this annotation applies to all the overriders of
 * the annotated method, including all the inheritance hierarchies,
 * which behaves similarly to <code>Must Call Super</code>.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * However, this is different from a <code>Must Call Super</code> annotation,
 * and it's capable of applying to arbitrary method inheritance hierarchies.

 * <b>Example</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * class A {
 *     @MustCallIt(scopeRoot = { B.class })
 *     public static final void checkPreconditions(B b) { }
 * }
 *
 * abstract class B {
 *     abstract void method1();
 *     abstract void method2();
 * }
 *
 * class C extends B {
 *     @Override
 *     void method1() {
 *         A.checkPreconditions(this); // must call
 *     }
 *     @Override
 *     void method2() {
 *         A.checkPreconditions(this); // must call
